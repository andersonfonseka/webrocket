## what is webrocket?

webrocket isn't just another java web framework. It's a definitive framework for blazing-fast web development with low learning curve.

## how to attest this afirmation?

Let's imagine how many techs concepts do you need to learn before to start a simple 'hello world', or select a framework by creating a simple 'Hello World' and start a project believing that will be easy to go on, but you figure out that this framework is not so easy as you thought.

Meanwhile, you figured out that your time spent on the project is to support your team with java web framework doubts rather than to code the main core project features.

Along the 20 years, I've been looking for a java web framework with low learning curve, sometimes I got an apparently easier way to develop a web app, but we need to face with some 'adaptations', we need to learn a javascript code, a css concept, to understand the web framework lifecycle (WFL) and so on.

Sometimes the WFL has their own rules that we need to accomplish, For example: why the Java Server Faces asks for the same getXXX twice? Why the old Struts exposes the HttpRequest and Response for developer in your action implementation, its okay but when we give a power to newbies, we open some **security breaches**.

## what differentiates webrocket from the others?

**It's easy, you don't need to learn anything besides Java**.
You don't need to learn many web concepts as Java Server Pages, Servlets, Routes & Flows, CSS, Javascript, Validations to start a simple web application.

If you want to dive into a simple way without a NPM that bring a thousand libraries to your notebook, a webrocket could be an alternative.
